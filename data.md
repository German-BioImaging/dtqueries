The following cases from https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/ have been identified
as TNBC by downloading the `nationwidechildrens.org_clinical_patient_brca.txt` file
associated with the data and checking for a value of `Negative` in the
'er_status_by_ihc', 'pr_status_by_ihc', and 'her2_status_by_ihc' columns. (See
