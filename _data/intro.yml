    One of the SPARQL queries provided in the slide deck has been copied below as an example.
    Importantly, though, in the demonstrator the query is then executed against Wikidata and
    the results are embedded in the page live.

    However, the values returned here are just strings. With linked data, we want to keep the unique
    identifiers. The next query returns the objects themselves which you can follow to view the
    data entry from where you can explore related concepts.
